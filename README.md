## Project Overview

This project implements a singly linked list data structure in C# with the primary goal of efficiency, reusability, and extensibility. The solution is designed using Visual Studio and is compatible with different platforms, such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Key technologies and tools used in this project include:

- C#: A powerful, modern, object-oriented programming language, used to implement the main logic of the LinkedList data structure.
- .NET Core: A cross-platform framework that provides a wide range of APIs and tools, enabling developers to create high-performance, reusable, and maintainable applications.
- Visual Studio: A widely-used IDE that provides an advanced environment for development, debugging, and testing the implemented features, as well as seamless integration with GitHub.

These technologies and tools contribute to the project's functionality, performance, and overall success, by offering a modern, efficient, and scalable foundation for the LinkedList implementation. Moreover, the chosen tools provide wide compatibility, allowing the project to serve a broader audience of developers.

## Installation Instructions

To use this LinkedList implementation in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/LinkedList.git
```

2. Open the `LinkedList.sln` file using Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution by clicking on `Build > Build Solution` in the menu.

4. Add a reference to the `LinkedList.dll` output file in your project.

## Usage Guide

To use the LinkedList in your application, follow the steps below:

1. Add the following using statement to your code:

```csharp
using LinkedListNamespace;
```

2. Create an instance of the LinkedList class:

```csharp
LinkedList<int> myList = new LinkedList<int>();
```

3. Perform operations on the linked list:

```csharp
myList.AddFirst(1);
myList.AddLast(2);

var firstElement = myList.First;
var lastElement = myList.Last;

myList.RemoveFirst();
myList.RemoveLast();

var listCount = myList.Count;
```

Please refer to the provided API documentation for a comprehensive list of available methods and their usage.

## Features and Functionality

1. Add elements to the beginning or the end of the list.
2. Remove elements from the beginning or the end of the list.
3. Efficient traversal of elements using iterators.
4. Retrieve elements at specific positions.
5. Clear the entire list.
6. Count the number of elements in the list.
7. Fully compatible with .NET and cross-platform runtime environments.
